## What is it?

View and edit Outpost 2: Divided Destiny sheets files. These configuration files (building.txt, mines.txt, morale.txt, space.txt, vehicles.txt and weapons.txt) were originally stored in sheets.vol. The OPU version unpacks these to `\OPU\base\sheets`. The demo techs are stored in '\OPU\maps\OfficialDemos'.

The Outpost 2 sheets files are text-based configuration files that define the stats and properties of all game elements - including building costs, vehicle capabilities, weapon damage, mining efficiency, and colonist morale systems. These files control the numerical balance of individual units and structures, while the tech tree (configured separately) determines research progression and what technologies unlock which items.

## Sheet Files Overview

**building.txt** - Defines all structures including hit points, armor, build costs, power requirements, storage capacity, and worker needs for all structures in the game.

**vehicles.txt** - Contains stats for all mobile units like lynx, trucks etc including health, armor, movement speed, cargo capacity, and build costs.

**weapons.txt** - Specifies weapon systems with damage values, range, reload time, and special effects like EMP or area damage for both vehicle-mounted and environmental weapons (disasters).

**morale.txt** - Controls the colonist happiness system with morale states, bonuses/penalties for research and production, and how various events affect colony satisfaction (morale).

**mines.txt** - Defines mining efficiency with different ore deposit yields (High/Med/Low) and how productivity changes over time.

**space.txt** - Lists space-based construction projects like satellites, launch vehicles, and orbital facilities with their costs and build times.
